            <h4>Early Career</h4>
            <h5>125cc World Championship</h5>
            <p>
              Born in Cervera, Catalonia, Spain, Márquez made his championship
              debut on 13 April 2008 at the 125cc 2008 Portuguese Grand Prix at
              the age of 15 years and 56 days.[12] Márquez achieved his first
              podium on 22 June 2008 at the British Grand Prix, in just his
              sixth race in the category, becoming the youngest Spanish rider to
              take a podium in Grand Prix motorcycle racing.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              For 2009, as a factory KTM rider, he scored another podium with
              his 3rd place at Jerez, before achieving his first pole position
              at the French Grand Prix at the age of 16 years and 89 days,
              becoming the youngest Spanish rider to take pole position in a
              motorcycle racing world championship
            </p>
            <br />
            <h5>Moto2 World Championship</h5>
            <p>
              Márquez moved into the Moto2 class for 2011, the first of an
              expected two-year deal,[17] as the sole rider of the new team
              Monlau Competición, run by his manager Emilio Alzamora. He
              finished 21st in Portugal, before taking his first victory in the
              class at the French Grand Prix.[18] At his home race in Catalonia,
              Márquez finished second behind championship leader Stefan Bradl,
              before another fall at the Silverstone,
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Having started from his first Moto2 pole position. With Bradl
              taking his fourth victory in the first six races, Márquez trailed
              him by 82 points at the end of the weekend.[19] Márquez made a
              mid-season surge up the championship standings, winning six of the
              next seven races to move within six points of Bradl in the
              championship standings.[20] In the Japanese Grand Prix,
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Márquez took his seventh pole position of the season but finished
              second to Andrea Iannone,[21] but that finish combined with a
              fourth place for Bradl, allowed Márquez to take the championship
              lead by a point.[22] At the Australian Grand Prix, Márquez was
              involved in an incident with Ratthapark Wilairot during free
              practice; Márquez crashed into the back of Wilairot after the
              session had been concluded, and for riding in an "irresponsible
              manner", was given a one-minute time penalty onto his qualifying
              time
